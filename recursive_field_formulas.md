# Recursive Field Formulas

This document extracts and organizes the mathematical relationships described in the "Recursive Field" scientific math song.

## Radial Growth

- **Radius formula:** The radius for the nth step is proportional to the square root of the step number: r_n = a * sqrt(n).
- **Amplitude constant:** In the song the amplitude `a` is 3, so the sequence of radii becomes: r_n = 3 * sqrt(n).

## Angular Progression

- **Golden angle:** Each successive step rotates by the golden angle. The angular coordinate is given by: theta_n = n * phi, where phi ≈ 137.508 degrees (≈ 2.39996 rad).

## Base and Loop Conditions

- **Base case:** For n = 1 the base radius is: r_1 = sqrt(3).
- **Rotation cycles:** Full rotations occur at integer multiples of pi. The song highlights the sequence: pi → 2pi → 3pi, which correspond to complete turns through the spiral.

These equations describe a Fermat (Vogel) spiral — a pattern also seen in sunflower seed arrangements and other natural phyllotaxis models.
